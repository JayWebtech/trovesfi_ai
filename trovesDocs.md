# Welcome to Troves (formerly STRKFarm)

## What is Troves?

Troves is a decentralized yield aggregator built on Starknet. It aims to maximize returns for users by automatically reallocating assets across various DeFi protocols.&#x20;

The platform leverages Starknet's scalability and low transaction costs to provide efficient yield farming opportunities. Users can deposit their assets into Troves' vaults, which then optimize and manage the yield farming process.&#x20;

In simple terms, **Troves uses vaults to earn passive income for its users.**

The platform focuses on transparency, security, and user-friendly interfaces to enhance the DeFi experience.

We rebranded from STRKFarm.





## Vision

Troves envisions to provide advanced DeFi solutions to Starknet users, starting with yield aggregation and optimizing user returns through automated vaults/strategies. The platform focuses on leveraging Starknet's scalability and low transaction costs to bring professional DeFi solutions to everyday onchain users.

By prioritizing transparency, security, and user experience, Troves aims to provide users with the best possible yield farming opportunities, fostering growth and innovation within the DeFi ecosystem.



## Features:

### 1. Strategies

We have various strategies with different types of yields and tokens asosciated with them. Each has a different process of generating passive income!

# How to deposit?

### Video tutorial:

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/AlB29BTULGI" %}





### Text tutorial with images:

* **Connect Your Wallet:** To deposit to any strategy, you need to have an Argent / Braavos wallet or any other Starknet-compatible wallet. Make sure you have some funds in it.
* Navigate to the "Strategies" tab to view the available strategies from the home page: [https://app.troves.fi/?tab=strategies](https://app.troves.fi/?tab=strategies)

<figure><img src="https://544104674-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FpPQw6sLqPpeJkiKP4Ai5%2Fuploads%2FWxrMAAjsenqDdm1rF20S%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=be6884d8-a790-4e07-bb78-17e23b668027" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



* **Select a Strategy**: Choose a strategy that aligns with your investment goals. Each strategy has different risk profiles and potential returns. We'll go ahead with STRK Sensei for now!

<figure><img src="https://544104674-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FpPQw6sLqPpeJkiKP4Ai5%2Fuploads%2Fq3UY0rL9O3ExiX1sNBpu%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=2947d3ce-4801-4dcd-8a30-18a3e8af2ac3" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



* In the deposit section, enter the amount of assets you want to deposit. We already have 1.52 $STRK in the strategy, let's add 10 $STRK more. Click on the deposit button.

<figure><img src="https://544104674-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FpPQw6sLqPpeJkiKP4Ai5%2Fuploads%2F53QrnFYxlAqALk5pBe9V%2Fimage.png?alt=media&#x26;token=c0ce5d57-78a1-4780-8959-e5e3eafafff8" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Once the transaction is signed with the wallet, the holdings section gets updated. (10+1.52 = 11.52 STRK). \`From now, your assets will be automatically managed by Troves to maximize returns.

# FAQ

Q. Will the reward be added directly to my balance or to my wallet? Do I need to deposit again if I want to continue reinvesting?

Answer: The reward will be added to your balance on the dapp itself, not to your wallet. You can invest more into the initial deposit if you want to earn more yields on your tokens.



Q. I can't see the funds I’ve withdrawn from the Auto Compounding STRK and Auto Compounding USDC strategies in my wallet.

Answer: These two strategies rely on zkLend. You can withdraw your funds at [https://app.zklend.com](https://app.zklend.com).



Q. When I use your platform, will I receive rewards from the Starknet DeFi Spring 2.0? Do I receive them in my wallet?

Answer: Since we use zkLend and Nostra (depending on the strategy), our contracts automatically receive the DeFi Spring rewards from them. The rewards are then added proportionally to the **user funds on the platform**. Therefore, you do not receive any rewards in your wallet.

#### Q. Why did my holdings decrease in the xSTRK Sensei strategy?

If you noticed a decrease in your holdings before 9 February 2025, this is due to an upgrade that enhances the accuracy of the displayed balance. The new logic ensures your holdings reflect real values more precisely.

Furthermore, deposits made before this date might show a larger decrease due to a price difference between xSTRK's true exchange rate on Endur and its price on DEXs. This is normal market behaviour, as prices adjust based on the opportunity cost for liquidity providers.

**Will I ever recover from this loss?**&#x20;

Yes, there's a good chance you'll recover this in 4-6 weeks. As this is a leveraged position, the impact was slightly higher, but it should recover within this timeframe. This is based on the current APYs and market conditions.

**Why did this affect my holdings?**

In the past, when you deposited STRK, we used Endur to convert it into xSTRK. However, upon withdrawal, we had to sell xSTRK on DEXs to repay the leverage. This was the only way to obtain STRK instantly, but it meant your final holdings could be influenced by price differences between Endur and DEXs.

From 9 February 2025, we have enhanced the system—Endur is no longer utilised for deposits, and all transactions now occur through DEXs. While your holdings may still fluctuate based on xSTRK’s price in DEXs (both positively and negatively), this approach is significantly better than before, as it eliminates the immediate price discrepancy that previously affected withdrawals.

**Why is there a price difference between xSTRK on Endur and DEXes?**

A 0.6–0.8% spread is normal and expected. The math behind this is:

Assuming the current STRK staking APY is 12%, a market maker on DEXs is supplying STRK, allowing you to instantly sell xSTRK for STRK. However, they could have used this STRK to stake instead and made a 12% APY. Since this represents an opportunity cost to them, they aim to generate enough from exchange fees and exchange rate spread to compensate for this opportunity cost. Therefore, if they accept your xSTRK and give you STRK, but then immediately unstake this xSTRK, they won't earn any yield for 21 days until they receive their STRK back. Consequently, the spread is approximately equivalent to the 21-day yield of Staking.

$$
\left(\frac{12\%}{52}\right) \times 3 = 0.7\%
$$

That said, the spread won't always remain this wide. It can fluctuate temporarily depending on buying and selling pressure in the market.

# NFT Levels System

### What is NFT levels system? 🤔

It's a unified points and NFT levels programme for our early supporters within the community. Various incentives campaigns will eventually result in earning NFTs from this programme.&#x20;

#### How to earn these NFTs?&#x20;

1. Invest in Troves strategies
2. [Refer friends](#referral-campaign)
3. Be active in community and participate in various campaigns launched by us (e.g. [OG Farmer NFT](https://docs.troves.fi/p/community/og-farmer-nft-campaign))

### Points on investment in strategies:

You shall earn points for each day your tokens are invested in the platform. The points you earn each day are represented by this formula: `$investment * your_points_multiplier`

#### Default points multiplier based on protocol TVL:

This points multiplier gives an edge to our early platform members. **This boost is dependent on the protocol TVL** and not on when a user first deposits. The earlier you are, the higher the multiplier.

| Initial TVL | Cutoff TVL | Point multiplier |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 0 →         | 1M:        | 1.5x             |
| 1M →        | 3M:        | 1.25x            |
| 3M →        | 5M:        | 1.1x             |
| Above 5M    |            | 1x               |



Also, the longer you hold, the higher your multiplier will become over time. This increase is governed by the following equation:

`current_multiplier = base_multiplier_based_on_tvl + (0.5 * hold_days / 365`)

```lolcode
hold_days: the number of days your portfolio has been >= $10. 
If a user's portfolio drops below $10, this is reset to 0

Example:
If the protocol's current TVL is 500k, the base multiplier is 1.5x. 
If a user has held for 10 days, their multiplier for today's point allocation is:
1.5 + (0.5 * 10 / 365) = 1.51x
```

### NFT levels - the points you require to reach that level

1. Level 1: 1,000 points&#x20;
2. Level 2: 10,000 points
3. Level 3: 50,000
4. Level 4: 200k
5. Level 5: 500k
6. Level 6: 750k
7. Level 7: 1M
8. Level 8: 3M
9. Level 9: 6M
10. Level 10: 10M

### Referral Campaign

The referral campaign is an extension of the levels campaign, allowing users to earn additional points by referring others. Learn more [here](referral-campaign).

# Sensei - Delta neutral Lending

## What is Sensei - Delta Neutral Lending ?

There are 4 strategies available in delta neutral strategy:

* STRK Sensei&#x20;
* USDC Sensei&#x20;
* ETH Sensei
* xSTRK Sensei

Deposit your STRK/ USDC/ ETH to automatically loop your funds between zkLend and Nostra to create a delta neutral position. This strategy is designed to maximize your yield on USDC/ STRK/ ETH. Your position is automatically adjusted periodically to maintain a healthy health factor. You receive a NFT as representation for your stake on Troves. You can withdraw anytime by redeeming your NFT for USDC or STRK or ETH. For upto 2 weeks, your position value may reduce due to high borrow APR. This will be compensated by STRK rewards.

For xSTRK Sensei, we use Vesu and Re7's pools respectively.

## Why?

Using the Sensei strategy in Troves offers several benefits:

* **Expertly Curated Strategies**: Sensei Strats are designed by experienced DeFi strategists, ensuring optimal asset allocation and yield optimization.
* **Diversification**: These strategies often include a mix of assets and protocols, reducing risk through diversification.
* **Automatic Risk Management**: health of the contracts are monitored in real time and automatically rebalanced, allowing for a hands-off investment approach.
* **Enhanced Returns**: By leveraging advanced strategies and automated compounding, Sensei Strats aim to maximize your returns efficiently.

## Technical details:

#### Contract style - ERC721&#x20;



#### Technical flow of funds

Assuming you deposit $1000 worth of STRK to STRK sensei, initially your tokens will be deposited to zkLend supply. Based on the $1000 deposit in ZkLend, a borrow will be taken equivalent to $384.21 of ETH which is calculated such that we maintain a target health factor (e.g. 1.3) overall from ZkLend which will be deposited to Nostra Money Markets' ETH supply. Furthermore, approximately $189.149 of STRK is borrowed from Nostra Money Markets corresponding to the $381.21 of ETH supplied which is again calculated such that we maintain a target health factor. The same process of depositing STRK starts from the beginning by depositing Nostra's borrow to ZkLend supply and the whole process is repeated 3 more times.

In conclusion, 4 steps of borrows of supply and borrow are taken which compounds the overall interest of user's deposit to a higher TVL. Furthermore, every 2 weeks, the strategy deposits your STRK rewards to ZkLend which appreciates your interest even more.

#### Risk management

TBD
# Vesu Fusion - Rebalancing vaults

[Vesu](https://vesu.xyz/) is a fully open and permissionless lending protocol built on Starknet. Users can lend crypto assets to earn, borrow assets, and build new lending experiences on Vesu without intermediaries. Vesu is built as a public infrastructure free for everyone to use.

### What are rebalancing vaults?

Vesu lets you create different [pools](https://vesu.xyz/pools) with their own curated assets. These can be used as collateral and borrowed. Independent curators can make custom pools with different risk levels. For example, Vesu has already seen curators like [Re7](https://re7.capital/) and [Alterscope](https://www.alterscope.org/) launch their pools. The downside of this approach is liquidity fragmentation. As a liquidity supplier, you may need to constantly monitor and rebalance your funds across multiple pools to optimize your yield for best returns. That’s where we come in—automating this process while ensuring diversification.



#### Why call it Fusion?

First, Troves vaults supply deposited assets to mutiple pools on Vesu, creating a single token called `vfToken` , which stands for "Vesu Fusion token". For example, the STRK vault is called vfSTRK.&#x20;

Second, it's cool.

#### Terminology:

1. **Pool:** Vesu's curated [pools](https://vesu.xyz/pools).
2. **Vault:** The strategies created by Troves (e.g. Vesu Fusion STRK).

### Technical details:

1. Vault standard: ERC4626
2. Source code: [here](https://github.com/trovesfi/strkfarm-contracts/tree/main/src/strategies/vesu_rebalance)
3. Audit report: [here](https://assets.troves.fi/strkfarm/audit_report_vesu_and_ekubo_strats.pdf), audited by [Cairo security clan](https://cairosecurityclan.com/).

### Risk framework:

1. We only **use verified pools** on Vesu to invest funds (i.e. Genesis, Re7 and Alterscope pools)
2. We will only stick to low and medium risk pools (for now).
3. Each pool has a maximum weight parameter configured, which determines the exposure the vault can take. The weight configuration is determined by the following factors:
   1. **The quality of collateral tokens in the pool:** If a pool is fully made of blue-chip collateral tokens, the maximum weight of the pool will be higher compared to others.&#x20;
   2. **The history of the pool:** Pools with less than 3-month history will be given less weightage over established pools. This is just an added cool-down period to avoid taking higher risk on new pools. However, there can be exceptions depending on the reputation of pool curator.&#x20;

**Current Weight mathematics:**

Note:&#x20;

1. The risk notation follows Vesu's criteria as outlined on their website.
2. For low TVL vaults (less than $1M), the quality of tokens isn't considered, as the overall risk is lower. This allows for the allocation of supply to high-yield pools.

| Vault TVL   | Condition        | Max weight                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| < $1M       | > 3month history | 100%                                                   |
|             | < 3month history | 20%                                                    |
| $1M - $2.5M | > 3month history | <p>80% (low risk pools)<br>50% (medium risk pools)</p> |
|             | < 3month history | <p>20% (low risk pools)<br>10% (medium risk pools)</p> |
| > $2.5 M    | > 3month history | <p>60% (low risk pools)<br>35% (medium risk pools)</p> |
|             | < 3month history | <p>15% (low risk pools)<br>7% (medium risk pools)</p>  |

**Blue chip pool definition:**

1. Contain highly liquid assets like BTC, ETH, wstETH, etc.
2. There is no counterparty risk.

**Pro tip:**

You can find real-time allocation of funds across these pools on the respective strategy pages through a flow chart like this. (supported only on desktop).

<figure><img src="https://544104674-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FpPQw6sLqPpeJkiKP4Ai5%2Fuploads%2Fs7hPWGZkA69vM9icju1k%2FSnip20250324_1.png?alt=media&#x26;token=afd1547a-ceb7-42c2-8163-2c86d09dd040" alt=""><figcaption><p>Sample flow chart of fund allocation. The actual numbers can be different. </p></figcaption></figure>

### Security approach:

1. The owner of the contract is an [Access control](../../developers/contracts#security-contracts) contract which defines various roles. The roles are divided among critical to low risk operations like rebalancing, deposit, withdraw, etc. The exact details of the roles and their job is mentioned [here](https://github.com/trovesfi/strkfarm-contracts/blob/main/src/strategies/vesu_rebalance/README.md#security-architecture-%EF%B8%8F).&#x20;
2. The super admin of access control is a [timelock contract](../../developers/contracts#security-contracts) which prevents immediate changes to access control changes or acting on super admin actions.&#x20;
3. **Hypernative monitoring:** TBA

### FAQs

1. **Are Defi spring rewards considered?**

Any rewards generated by corresponding pools on Vesu are automatically harvested every Saturday and added to the vault, increasing your token holdings. The STRK rewards are automatically swapped to underlying token of the vault.&#x20;



2. **If Vesu airdrops, will we get the airdrop?**

Yes, any airdropped token will be given to users of the vault. We will work with Vesu to ensure the same. **Note: Vesu hasn't announced any airdrop**. We want to be clear upfront, as people may speculate on this.



3. **Does the vault take fees?**

As with any of our strategies, _**we take a 10% fee only on rewards generated. This includes interest, Defi spring rewards, etc.**_

# Ekubo - CL Vaults

[Ekubo](https://ekubo.org/) is a cutting-edge AMM built on Starknet. It features liquidity management and a gas-efficient architecture which anyone can use it! It's the Uniswap of Starknet, but much better and optimised!

### What are concentrated liquidity vaults?

Ekubo lets you provide liquidity to token pairs in a much more focused way - within specific price ranges (just like Uniswap V3). This boosts capital efficiency and fee earnings, especially for pairs with tight price movements like xSTRK/STRK. But with higher efficiency comes more complexity.

To stay in the most profitable range, you need to _constantly monitor the price_, adjust your position, and _rebalance_ as the market shifts. That takes a lot of efforts and time to do it manually.

That’s where STRKFarm comes in.

Our concentrated liquidity vault handles this entire process for you. It **picks the optimal range, provides liquidity, repositions when needed, and reinvests the rewards—all automatically**. So you get the benefits of advanced liquidity management!



In simple terms, here’s what the vault does:

* Monitors and moves your LP position to stay in the most profitable price range
* Collects trading fees
* Reinvests those fees along with extra rewards from DeFi Spring

**The best part? You don’t have to do any rebalancing yourself.**



### Technical details:

1. Vault standard: No particular standard but close to ERC4626.
2. Source code: [https://github.com/strkfarm](https://github.com/trovesfi/strkfarm-contracts/tree/main/src/strategies/cl_vault)

### Understanding Position States in Concentrated Liquidity

When you deposit into the CL vault, your funds are used to provide liquidity within a specific price range on Ekubo (similar to Uniswap V3). Depending on where the current market price is relative to that range, your position might be held in xSTRK, STRK, or a mix of both.

Here’s how vault behaves:

* **Price is below the range** → Your position is completely in **xSTRK**
* **Price is above the range** → Your position is completely in **STRK**
* **Price is inside the range** → Your position is a **mix of xSTRK and STRK**, and **actively** earning fees

### How concentrated liquidity works:

Liquidity is only active (and used in swaps) when the market price falls within the range set by the strategy. Outside that range, the LP position becomes idle which means it's inactive and not earning fees. When this happens, the vault ends up fully in one token or the other.

The vault constantly monitors market conditions and adjusts the range when needed, so you don’t have to worry about being out of range for long!

#### Example:

Let’s say the vault adds liquidity between **$0.98 and $1.01** for xSTRK/STRK.

* If the current price is **$0.96**, your liquidity sits entirely in **xSTRK**.
* If the current price is **$1.03**, your liquidity is fully in **STRK**.
* If the price is **$1.00**, you’re in-range, holding **both tokens** and earning trading fees.

### FAQs

**Q: What do I earn from this vault?**

You earn trading fees from the xSTRK/STRK pool on Ekubo. On top of that, rewards like DeFi Spring incentives are auto-compounded back into the vault to boost your returns!



**Q: How is this better than manually providing liquidity on Ekubo?**

Manual LPing means you have to track price movements, adjust your ranges, and reinvest rewards on your own. Troves automates all of that!



**Q: Is there any risk of impermanent loss?**

Yes, as with any liquidity position, there's always some risk of impermanent loss. However, since xSTRK and STRK usually move together in price, the risk here is relatively low.



**Q. Does the vault take fees?**

As with any of our strategies, _**we take a 10% fee only on rewards generated. This includes interest, Defi spring rewards, etc.**_ Furthermore, the APYs you see are post-fees.
